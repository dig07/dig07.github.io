	<div class="panel-body">
	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on people all over the world, with drastic changes to their living conditions and lifestyles. To tackle the many challenges which have arisen, great efforts have been made to find effective solutions which encompass the key principles of humanity as well as the heights of technological developments. Information, and the way it is handled and distributed, has played and will continue to play a key role within these solutions: now more than ever, there is a strong need for clear ideas, facts and reliable data, all of which need to be made accessible to the general public.</p>
	<br>
	<p>We realised that while the models which are used to study the spread of the pandemic are often mentioned in news articles or statements from government entities, their features are rarely discussed in detail, perhaps to avoid confusing members of the general public. However, as these models have strongly influenced the policies adopted by governments around the world, it is evident that the information they hold is of vital importance. Therefore, we decided to create a platform which would help the users to visualise models for the spread of a pandemic.</p>

	<div class="panel-body">
	<h3>What does the simulation show?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Daily movements of the modelled population as they travel to school, work, and other locations.</li>
		<li>The effect of lockdown measures such as working from home, closing non-essential businesses, and suspending schools, on the growth of a pandemic.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Notable features:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Can take user inputs to modify population demographics, and the mitigation strategy to implement within the model.</li>
		<li>Modular design to ‘future-proof’ the simulation, making it easier to implement new models and variables.</li>
		<li>Clear, understandable interface, with explanations of the implemented models and assumptions, and of the results of the strategies, in order to make the information as accessible to the general public as possible.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The spread of the pandemic is treated with a simple probabilistic model which relies upon two key factors: the predisposition of an individual to the infection, affected by their vulnerability and compliance to social policies, and the density of infected people within a given location. This model will be corrected and enhanced as the project progresses.</p>
	<p>The current version of the application is a prototype, and will be improved further in the future. We aim to make the final version accessible directly through this website for ease of use. The selected parameters button below shows some of the parameters the user will be able to set for the simulation. The current version of the prototype can be found at <a href="https://github.com/GiovanniDAddario/LAPRAS" target="_top">https://github.com/GiovanniDAddario/LAPRAS</a>.</p>
